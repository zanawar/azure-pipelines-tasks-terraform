# Terraform CLI for Azure Devops

This tasks enables running terraform cli commands from Azure Devops Build and Release pipelines. The task is compatible with both Linux and Windows based build agents. It supports the following CLI commands
- version
- init
- plan
- apply
- validate
- import
- refresh
- force-unlock (under the alias `forceunlock`)

Terraform is required to exist on the build agent prior to running this task. See TerraformInstaller task within this repository to install terraform.

** If using hosted Ubuntu build agent, terraform installation should NOT be required as terraform is already installed on these agents.
## Development Setup
While not required, its strongly suggested to use Visual Studio Code. The repo includes configuration for executing tasks and debugging in Visual Studio Code
### Dependencies
The cli for Azure DevOps `tfx-cli` must be installed to upload the task and test in an Azure DevOps project.
```
npm install -g tfx-cli
```
### Install NPM Packages
Ensure that your command line's current directory is set to the TerraformCLI dir
```
cd d:\code\azure-pipelines-tasks-terraform\TerraformCLI
```
Run `npm install` to install the task dependencies.
```
npm install
```
### Create environment file
In order to execute the task locally, a .env file needs to be created. The .env file will set the parameters that are typically set when editing the task in Build or Release pipeline. This file should be created within the root of the TerrformCLI folder.

The example below contains all the possible inputs the task supports

```shell
# These indicate where the task will create installed tools and temp files
# These can remain as-is.
AGENT_TOOLSDIRECTORY=./../_test-agent/tools
AGENT_TEMPDIRECTORY=./../_test-agent/temp

# These settings are needed to access secure files that are uploaded to Pipelines > Library > Secure Files.
# The connection handshake is currently happening when the task starts.
# This means these settings currently have to be in place when running locally even if you did not specify a secure file
# The azure devops url to your target or (i.e. https://dev.azure.com/chzipp)
SYSTEM_TEAMFOUNDATIONCOLLECTIONURI=my-azure-devops-org-url
# The name of the project within the org provided above
SYSTEM_TEAMPROJECT=my-azure-devops-org-project
# Personal Access Token for authentication
ENDPOINT_AUTH_PARAMETER_SYSTEMVSSCONNECTION_ACCESSTOKEN=my-personal-access-token

# The command to execute
INPUT_COMMAND=init

# The path to the terraform templates to use when running the task
# The path provided will setup a resource group in azure and store state in azure storage
INPUT_WORKINGDIRECTORY=./../TerraformTemplates/sample

# The path to the var file to use when executing the commands that require it
INPUT_COMMANDOPTIONS='-var-file default.vars'

# This can be left as is, this would the service connection name that points to the deployment target (i.e. azure subscription)
INPUT_ENVIRONMENTSERVICENAME=dev

# These specify the service principal credentials to use when executing plan and apply commands against azure.
ENDPOINT_AUTH_SCHEME_dev=ServicePrincipal
ENDPOINT_DATA_dev_SUBSCRIPTIONID=my-target-env-subscription-id
ENDPOINT_AUTH_PARAMETER_dev_TENANTID=my-target-env-tenant-id
ENDPOINT_AUTH_PARAMETER_dev_SERVICEPRINCIPALID=my-target-env-service-principal-app-id
ENDPOINT_AUTH_PARAMETER_dev_SERVICEPRINCIPALKEY=my-target-env-service-principal-key

# Indicates what type of terraform backend to use. Current valid values are 'local', 'azurerm'.
INPUT_BACKENDTYPE=local

# If using 'azurerm' backend, this is the service name to the tfstate storage account's subscription
# This can be left as is
# INPUT_BACKENDSERVICEARM=backend

# If using 'azurerm' backend, these indicate the resource group, storage account name, container name, and file name used to store state.
# These are not required if using local backend
# INPUT_ENSUREBACKEND=true
# INPUT_BACKENDAZURERMRESOURCEGROUPNAME=my-resource-group-name-here
# INPUT_BACKENDAZURERMRESOURCEGROUPLOCATION=my-resource-group-location
# INPUT_BACKENDAZURERMSTORAGEACCOUNTNAME=my-storage-account-name
# INPUT_BACKENDAZURERMSTORAGEACCOUNTSKU=my-storage-account-sku
# INPUT_BACKENDAZURERMCONTAINERNAME=my-blob-container-name
# INPUT_BACKENDAZURERMKEY=my-blob-file-name

# If using 'azurerm' backend, these specify the service principal credentials to use when accessing the storage account
# These are not required if using local backend
# ENDPOINT_AUTH_SCHEME_backend=ServicePrincipal
# ENDPOINT_DATA_backend_SUBSCRIPTIONID=my-backend-subscription-id
# ENDPOINT_AUTH_PARAMETER_backend_TENANTID=my-backend-tenant-id
# ENDPOINT_AUTH_PARAMETER_backend_SERVICEPRINCIPALID=my-backend-service-principal-app-id
# ENDPOINT_AUTH_PARAMETER_backend_SERVICEPRINCIPALKEY=my-backend-service-principal-key
```
### Update main.tf Backend for Sample Template
If using the sample template within TerraformTemplates and using local backend, remove the section indicating remote azurerm backend

TerraformTemplates/sample/main.tf
```tf
# comment this out if using local
terraform{
    backend "azurerm"{}
}
```
## Compile
The `npm run build` script will compile the typescript down to standard es6 javascript
```
npm run build
```
## Run
The `npm start` script will compile the typescript and execute the task using the values specified in .env.
```
npm start
```
## Test
The `npm test` script will compile the typescript and execute the unit tests.
```
npm test
```
## Debug (Using Visual Studio Code)
From the Debug panel, set the configuration to `debug:tf cli` and press F5.
The following configurations have also been provided to support debugging other scenarios
- `debug:tf cli:tests` - Debug the unit tests.
- `debug:tf cli:e2e` - Debug the end-to-end tests.
## Upload (To Azure DevOps)
The following will upload the task to an Azure DevOps account. This will allow for testing how the UI will present the group/input configuration in task.json. Additionally, this will allow for executing the task as part of a build and/or release pipeline within Azure DevOps.

Ensure the `tfx-cli` is logged into the target Azure DevOps account.
```
tfx login
```
The `npm run upload` will upload the task to the current authorized Azure DevOps Org & Project.

The `tfx login` only needs to be executed once. After this is executed, `npm run upload` can be executed immediately.
